# IndexActiveDirectoryToSearch - Index a Subset of Active Directory to Azure Search

We use this project to index our Active Directory environment to Azure search, which allows us to make it available to a mobile app conveniently and quickly.

Search is much faster than LDAP queries and we reduce the risk of direct queries to a service connected to internal AD. I've written some AD libraries you may find useful, please feel free to take.
